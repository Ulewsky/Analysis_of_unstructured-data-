# Analysis of unstructured data


## Assignment nr 1


## Assignment nr 2

Visit the “Publications” section of the Hugo Steinhaus Center website (http:
//prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~hugo/HSC/hsc.html). Scrape the data on research
papers from that site and generate a cooperation network of authors in the
following way:

1. members of HCS are the nodes,
2. the size of a node is proportional to the number of papers co-authored by
the node,
3. a link between two nodes means a paper written together by the corresponding members,
4. a weight of the link indicates the total number of common papers.
Visualize the network (with names and link weights). Detect the connected
components.

  * Candidates (categorize tweets: cointains only Biden/Trump/both candidates).
  * Cities.
4. Things which should be checked:
  * Check the number of tweets/likes/retweets over time.
  * SET_1: Check if other hashtags are included in tweets (popularity)
  * SET_2: Check which hashtags are used?
  * Check the most popular words.
  * Check the sentiment of tweets.
  * Check the sentiment over time.
  * SET_2 when people tweets (which part of the day).
